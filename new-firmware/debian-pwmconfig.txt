iomega@ix4-200d:~$ sudo pwmconfig
Found the following fan sensors:ch full speed...l speed yourols. (pwm)
   hwmon0/fan1_input     current speed: 1781 RPM
   hwmon0/fan2_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
   hwmon0/fan3_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!
   hwmon0/fan4_input     current speed: 0 ... skipping!

Warning!!! This program will stop your fans, one at a time,
for approximately 5 seconds each!!!
This may cause your processor temperature to rise!!!
If you do not want to do this hit control-C now!!!
Hit return to continue: 

Testing pwm control hwmon0/pwm1 ...
  hwmon0/fan1_input ... speed was 1781 now 744
    It appears that fan hwmon0/fan1_input
    is controlled by pwm hwmon0/pwm1
Would you like to generate a detailed correlation (y)?

Testing pwm control hwmon0/pwm2 ...
  hwmon0/fan1_input ... speed was 1781 now 1780
    no correlation

No correlations were detected.
There is either no fan connected to the output of hwmon0/pwm2,
or the connected fan has no rpm-signal connected to one of
the tested fan sensors. (Note: not all motherboards have
the pwm outputs connected to the fan connectors,
check out the hardware database on http://www.almico.com/forumindex.php)

Did you see/hear a fan stopping during the above test (n)? n

Testing pwm control hwmon0/pwm3 ...
  hwmon0/fan1_input ... speed was 1781 now 1786
    no correlation

No correlations were detected.
There is either no fan connected to the output of hwmon0/pwm3,
or the connected fan has no rpm-signal connected to one of
the tested fan sensors. (Note: not all motherboards have
the pwm outputs connected to the fan connectors,

Did you see/hear a fan stopping during the above test (n)?

Testing is complete.
Please verify that all fans have returned to their normal speed.

The fancontrol script can automatically respond to temperature changes
of your system by changing fanspeeds.
Do you want to set up its configuration file now (y)? y
What should be the path to your fancontrol config file (/etc/fancontrol)? 

Select fan output to configure, or other action:
1) hwmon0/pwm1	       3) Just quit	      5) Show configuration
2) Change INTERVAL     4) Save and quit
select (1-n): 1

Devices:
hwmon0 is adt7473

Current temperature readings are as follows:
hwmon0/temp1_input	37
hwmon0/temp2_input	42
hwmon0/temp3_input	37

Select a temperature sensor as source for hwmon0/pwm1:
1) hwmon0/temp1_input
2) hwmon0/temp2_input
3) hwmon0/temp3_input
4) None (Do not affect this PWM output)
select (1-n): 2

Enter the low temperature (degree C)
below which the fan should spin at minimum speed (20): 43

Enter the high temperature (degree C)
over which the fan should spin at maximum speed (60): 48

Enter the PWM value (0-255) to use when the temperature
is over the high temperature limit (255): 


Select fan output to configure, or other action:
